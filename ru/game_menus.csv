Hotkeys are listed at the beginning of each battle, take a moment to memorize them.^The company system allows you to split your units into up to 8 infantry, cavalry, or artillery companies.

Said technology system can be accessed by the player via the reports menu, where it is listed under the technology menu. Certain technologies are required for others to unlock, and researching a technology takes two in-game years, (between 12 and 60 days, depending on your chosen game speed).^Researching technologies is vital for the survival of your nation, as the AI factions will also gain access to technologies as time progresses.^Some factions, such as Prussia, have already unlocked advanced armaments at game start and should be approached accordingly.^^This mod also has various diplomacy features, which are accessable via dialogs with minister of your faction.

After the national committee signed a treaty in the national palace, {s33} ratified the agreement in the early morning hours and effectively ended {s32}'s national sovereignty. Italian Unification has just become a looming reality.
menu_provocation_created1|Tensions between {s31} and {s32}!^^Public disagreements over the borders created during the Vienna Congress have led to open hostility, with loyalist militias belonging to both states clashing in the entire border region. {s31} has decried the violence, stating their intentions to defend their ethnic enclaves in the nation should it be necessary, while {s32} has declared the fighters as hostile, sovereign actors in an attempt to ease international pressure.^Telegrams and messengers on horseback have been arriving in the capitals of the Western powers since the early morning hours, trying to secure their support for what might well be the prelude to another bloody conflict.
menu_provocation_created2|Aboltionist incident!^^News reached the {s31}'s capital in the evening hours that one of its most prolific traders, and in more colonial regions more so known as one of the richest slave traders in the world had been captured, and subsequently executed by staunch abolitionists who had sworn loyalty to the {s32}. {s32} has refused to hand over the perpetrators, probably more so due to the fact that the trader had been a thorn in the side of their traders for many years. Local militia companies have been promising revenge should the abolitionists not be surrendered, and the situation is quickly escalating. Only aimed de-escalation can avert conflict now.
menu_provocation_created3|Territorial claims of {s31} against {s32}!^^A political movement supporting the revanchist aims of {s31} has lead to a boil-over in tensions, with the leadership vowing to claim territory that they believe to be rightfully theirs from {s32}! Some pacifists claim the tension could be resolved over tea, but the military of {s31} is already mobilizing for warfare, and will soon try to take the territory they claim. In Europe, the borders between regions are often messy, and linguistic or ethnic groups can be in multiple countries. Whatever leads the revanchists to believe their claim, one can only hope the war resolves swiftly.
menu_provocation_created4|Border skirmish can lead to full conflict!^^Soldiers from {s31} were killed in a border skirmish with {s32}, either through malice or incompetence, and attempts to peacefully resolve the situation can fail.

Calls for a ceasefire, or even peace, to allow Laissez-faire trade to open up again have been growing louder, and more emphasised.

menu_prussia_unification_austria_defeated|The German War^^The war between Prussia and the German Confederation, led by the Austro-Hungarian Emperor Franz Joseph I, has come to a close.

menu_ww1_event1|Heir to the throne of {s1} assassinated!^Archduke Franz Ferdinand of {s1} and his wife Sophie, Duchess of Hohenberg, were shot dead by a Bosnian Serb student during their official visit to Sarajevo. ^Austrian opinion regards the tragedy as the result of a well-prepared conspiracy. The Heir apparent was advised not to undertake the journey, as certain desperadoes were planning an attempt against his life. However, he disregarded the warning and proceeded with his visit. ^Earlier in the day, they had survived a first attempt to take their lives when a grenade was thrown at their car.  The couple was not injured and, after a short stay in the City Council, insisted on seeing those wounded by the explosion. This is when the assassin took his chance and made the attack.^When news of the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand was imparted to the aged emperor, he exclaimed, ''Terrible, terrible! I am spared nothing.''^It is reported that several Bosnians and Serbs have been arrested at Sarajevo for complicity in the plot which is said to have wide ramifications. Tensions are on their peak and demonstrations are taking place.
menu_ww1_event2|The incidents in Sarajevo proved the existence of a subversive movement whose object it is to separate certain territories from the {s1}. ^His movement, which came into being under the very eyes of the Serbian authorities, subsequently found expression outside of its territory in acts of terrorism and murders.^It is clear from the statements and confessions of the criminals, that the murder was conceived at Belgrade. In order to prevent an escalation, the {s2} must condemn these ideas and the involvement of its subjects in the criminal activities and vow to proceed with utmost rigor against anyone who shall become guilty.^The government of {s1} will furthermore pledge itself: ^1. to suppress every publication which shall incite to hatred and contempt of the Monarchy, against the territorial integrity or that may serve to nourish this campaign^2. to dissolve all criminal associations, to confiscate their means of propaganda and to take such measures as are necessary to ensure that they may not continue their activities under other names or forms^3. to remove from the military and civilian service all those who have been guilty of carrying on the propaganda against Austria-Hungary^4. to agree to the cooperation in Serbia of organs of the Austro-Hungarian Government in the suppression of the subversive movement ^5. to institute a judicial inquiry against the participants in the conspiracy who may be found in Serbian territory; the organs of the Austro-Hungarian Government delegated for this purpose will take part in the proceedings to be held^6. to prevent the participation of Serbian authorities in the smuggling of weapons and explosives across the frontier and to punish severely those who assisted the criminals ^7. to make explanations to the  Austro-Hungarian Government concerning the unjustifiable utterances of high functionaries in Serbia and abroad, who, without regard for their position, have not hesitated to express themselves in a manner hostile toward Austria-Hungary ^The government of {s1} awaits the reply of the Royal Government.
menu_ww1_event3|The government of {s2} has received the communication of the government of {s1} and is convinced that its reply will dissipate any misunderstanding threatening to destroy the friendly and neighbourly relations ^The Serbian government binds itself further:^1.  to severely punish the incitement of hatred and contempt for {s1} and its territorial integrity and to supress every publication that may serve to nourish this campaign^2.  to dissolve the Narona Odbrana aswell as every society which should set against {s1}^3. to dismiss those belonging to the military and civil services that have been proved by judicial investigation to be guilty of actions against {s1}^4. to accept every cooperation which does not run counter to international and criminal law but confesses it is not clear about the sense and the scope of the demand to permit the cooperation of Austro-Hungarian officials on Serbian territory ^5. to begin an investigation against all those involved in the conspiracy who are in its territory. As far as the cooperation in this investigation of Austrian officials is concerned, this cannot be accepted, as this is a violation of the constitution and of criminal procedure^6. to amplify and assert the existing measures against the smuggling of arms and explosives and to punish severely those who have assisted the criminals^7. to give explanations about the expressions which its officials have made which could have been hostile to {s1} and, as soon as the Austrian government points out where they were made and prooves that they have actually been made by those concerned, to take care that the necessary evidencess and proofs are collected^^Serbian government believes it to be of common interest to not rush the solution of this affair and therefore, in case the government of the {s1} should not consider itself satisfied, is ready to accept a peaceable solution, be it by reffereing to the International Court or by leaving it to the decision of the Great Powers which participated in the working out of the declaration given by the {s2} when it renounced the attitudes of protest and opposition to the annexation of Bosnia-Herzegovina.
