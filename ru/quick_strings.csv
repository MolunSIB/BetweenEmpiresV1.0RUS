qstr_Converted_breech_loa|Converted breech-loaded rifles have several issues. They have big caliber, because of which during fast shooting the barrel heats up so much that it becomes hard to handle rifle during reload or melee fighting. Inserted breech-loading mechanisms are not perfect and often cause cartridge case to jam inside after shot, and being hard to get out. Next step in firearms rearmament should be adopting new breech-loaded rifle: it will have much smaller caliber than before, which will improve bullet ballistics, and will have improved breech-loading mechanism, that will further increase rate of fire by making reloading process easier.^^Effects: army changes it's firearms to small-caliber breech-loading rifles.

qstr_You_were_born_the_{r|You were born the {reg3?daughter:son} of a minor noble, who's influence was decreasing with the new times. You had everything you needed: good education, happy childhood. You visited noble feasts and celebrations with your father, so you were welcome after his death, as also you managed to save family funds.
qstr_You_were_born_the_{re|You were born the {reg3?daughter:son} of a small businessman, always dealing with different sorts of customers and partners. Your parents were wealth enough to send you to a private school. You father wasn't able to deal with the new times, which changed trading technoligies, so after his death you had only a small part of his business.
qstr_You_were_born_the_{reg|You were born the {reg3?daughter:son} of a minor staff officer, who took a part in a lot of conflicts of the early 19th century. Born in one of his campaigns, you never knew your mother. Although your father tried to teach you everything he knew, he wasn't a good teacher, so after his death you had only some army skills and his last bought gun.
qstr_{reg3?daughter:son}|{reg3?daughter:son}
qstr_You_were_born_the_{reg3|You were born the {reg3?daughter:son} of a mafia capo, who was a respected member of a local band. Your father didn't want you to follow his steps, so you had a chance for a lawful life. But circumstances of the new times left you no choice, so after his death you replaced him with his mafia heritage.
qstr_You_were_born_the_{reg3?|You were born the {reg3?daughter:son} of a university professor. As a son of a science man, you got a very good education. Although your family wasn't rich your father tought you that money aren't the most important, so after his death you entered the world with a good amount of knowledge.
qstr_You_were_born_the_{reg3?d|You were born the {reg3?daughter:son} of a regular factory labourer, who spent his life toughly working for his family. Although you were tought to live fairly, your father gave you freedom of chosing your future profession. After his death, you still was seeking for a business to get in your live.
qstr_You_were_a_child_of_|You were a child of the steppe, born to a tribe of wandering nomads who lived in great camps throughout the arid grasslands. Like the other tribesmen, your family revered horses above almost everything else, and they taught you how to ride almost before you learned how to walk. 
qstr_As_the_{reg3?daughte|As the {reg3?daughter:son} of a thief, you had very little 'formal' education. Instead you were out on the street, begging until you learned how to cut purses, cutting purses until you learned how to pick locks, all the way through your childhood. Still, these long years made you streetwise and sharp to the secrets of cities and shadowy backways.
qstr_You_were_as_far_as_a|You were, as far as anyone outside the university could tell, a studious person. Always obeying the rules, always getting good grades. If that was an illusion or not, only you know. But suffice you say, you were in university, be it because of a patronage from someone wealthy or because your family was rich enough to afford it, and even if you were a student whose record was questionable at best, it gained you valuable insight and experience.
qstr_The_thrumming_of_mac|The thrumming of machines and the pounding of metal is a sound you know better than anyone. It was hard work, waking up real early and going to bed real late, working every second between those two events under the watchful eye of demanding overseers. You became intimately familiar with technology, particularly industry, as you worked. Your calloused hands are proof that you know hard work, and though you left the factory life behind, it will never leave you.
qstr_Living_on_the_street|Living on the streets was tough. Stealing to live, if you could call the scraps you could get any sort of proper life, was part and parcel of your existence. Everyone looked down at you as a street urchin, as someone to be reviled and pitied at best, or actively driven out at worst. This hard life gave you perspective, it gave you skills others may see as unsavory. Luckily, in war, unsavory skills are quite useful.
qstr_Extra_extra!_Local_n|Extra extra! Local newspaper has a bunch of stories that you never really cared for! Hawking newspapers all day certainly improved your skills at speaking, making people who otherwise wouldn't care for the goings-on to buy a newspaper. Of course, a keen knowledge of business is hardly a bad thing. Perhaps the skills you learned will do you well in the new world you find yourself in.
qstr_As_a_{reg3?girl:boy}|As a {reg3?girl:boy} growing out of childhood, you rode the great steppes on a horse of your own, learning the ways of the grass and the desert. Although you sometimes went hungry, you became a skillful hunter and pathfinder in this trackless country. Your body too started to harden with muscle as you grew into the life of a nomad {reg3?woman:man}.
qstr_You_were_drawn_to_th|You were drawn to the human body, and how it functioned. Perhaps a family member got sick, and you vowed to help others through the same. Perhaps you liked giving people hope and treating them. Maybe you just liked cutting things apart. Either way, in college, you went into the fields of medicine.
qstr_Perhaps_you_live_som|Perhaps you live somewhere where grand architecture spirals up into the sky, or where imposing walls surrounded you. Or a small village, with beautiful and ancientchurches, was where your interest in buildings came. It doesn’t matter, because you loved buildings,and learned to raise them up in university. Perhaps now, you shall use that to tear them down. 
qstr_Philology_the_study_|Philology, the study of languages and how they compare, is extremely important to the diplomacy of Europe, where besides Latin, language like English, Russian, French, and so forth mustbe mastered. Studying this in university gave you a keen tongue and learned how to speak and communicate withthe high lords and common folk across the many realms of Europe.
qstr_{reg3?daughter:man}|{reg3?daughter:man}
qstr_{reg3?woman:man}|{reg3?woman:man}
qstr_You_decided_to_lead_|You decided to lead a bohemian life, travelling from place to place playing music. This has put you in touch with the common people, and most of your interactions with higher society consisted of a tip of the hat when they tossed a coin into your cup. But still, you have learned how to advertise yourself, how to speak to a crowd, and how to entertain. All very useful skills, indeed.
qstr_You’re_a_businessp|You’re a businessperson, someone who has capital and funds enough to make more   capital. Perhaps you rose from the working class, or perhaps you started with a small loan from your family.   Either way, you’re well-off and can definitely get a foot in wherever you go now.
qstr_You_fell_into_crimin|You fell into criminal life, and never really got out. The police know who you are    in some places, and in others they leer as if they should know you. No matter, of course, since between arrests   and brief jail times, you’ve learned how to survive outside the law.
qstr_You_went_to_the_Amer|You went to the Americas to seek a new life, perhaps to escape persecution   in Europe, perhaps to make a new life free from debts. Whatever your reasons, you took the journey   across to the Atlantic. And now, for whatever reason, you have returned to Europe.
qstr_You_fought_in_the_Cr|You fought in the Crimea, either with or against Russia, and your   experiences in that war were invaluable and horrific. You saw men die, you saw foolish cavalry   charges, you saw the awesome power of cannons. As you returned home, weary and war-shocked, you knew you would never be the same.
qstr_Only_you_know_exactl|Only you know exactly what caused you to give up your old life and become an adventurer. Still, it was not a difficult choice to leave, with the rage burning brightly in your heart. You want vengeance. You want justice. What was done to you cannot be undone, and these debts can only be paid in blood...
qstr_Only_you_know_exactly|Only you know exactly what caused you to give up your old life and become an adventurer. All you can say is that you couldn't bear to stay, not with the memories of those you loved so close and so painful. Perhaps your new life will let you forget, or honour the name that you can no longer bear to speak...
qstr_Only_you_know_exactly_|Only you know exactly what caused you to give up your old life and become an adventurer. You're not even sure when your home became a prison, when the familiar became mundane, but your dreams of wandering have taken over your life. Whether you yearn for some faraway place or merely for the open road and the freedom to travel, you could no longer bear to stay in the same place. You simply went and never looked back...
qstr_Only_you_know_exactly_w|Only you know exactly what caused you to give up your old life and become an adventurer. However, you know you cannot go back. There's nothing to go back to. Whatever home you may have had is gone now, and you must face the fact that you're out in the wide wide world. Alone to sink or swim...
qstr_Only_you_know_exactly_wh|Only you know exactly what caused you to give up your old life and become an adventurer. To everyone else, it's clear that you're now motivated solely by personal gain. You want to be rich, powerful, respected, feared. You want to be the one whom others hurry to obey. You want people to know your name, and tremble whenever it is spoken. You want everything, and you won't let anyone stop you from having it...
